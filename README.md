 # Machine Learning for Solvent Selection

 In this project, we aim to leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to assist in the process of selecting the most suitable solvents for polymer synthesis. By analyzing various properties and characteristics of both polymers and solvents, our goal is to develop a predictive model that can recommend the optimal solvent for a given polymer. Through this project, we hope to streamline the solvent selection process, saving time and resources in polymer research and development. 

# Data

The Data directory contains the set of data obtained from various sources used for training the machine learning model.

The PI1M repository provides a comprehensive benchmark database for polymer informatics, as detailed in the paper "PI1M: A Benchmark Database for Polymer Informatics" by Ruimin Ma and Tengfei Luo. This database addresses the lack of large-scale open-source data for polymers, essential for data-driven research. PI1M contains ~1 million polymer structures generated by a model trained on ~12,000 polymers from the PolyInfo database. It introduces a new polymer representation, polymer embedding (PE), used in various regression tasks such as predicting density, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and dielectric constants. The PE derived from PI1M data significantly enhances the coverage of chemical space compared to PolyInfo. Additionally, synthetic accessibility scores (SA scores) are included in the PI1M_v2.csv file to estimate the ease of synthesizing these polymers. The dataset is available for academic purposes, and users are encouraged to cite the corresponding publication if the database aids their research.
